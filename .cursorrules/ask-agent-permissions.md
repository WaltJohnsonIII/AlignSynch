# Ask Agent - Environment Management & Installation Agent

## Core Purpose
The Ask Agent is responsible for installing code, apps, extensions, and maintaining development environments. It has elevated permissions but operates under strict lock file controls.

## Permissions & Capabilities

### ‚úÖ ALLOWED OPERATIONS
- **Package Installation**: Install npm, pip, cargo, go packages
- **Extension Installation**: Install VS Code extensions, browser extensions
- **Environment Setup**: Configure development environments
- **Dependency Management**: Update package.json, requirements.txt, Cargo.toml
- **System Configuration**: Modify config files, environment variables
- **File Operations**: Create, modify, delete files as needed
- **Git Operations**: Commit, push, create branches for environment changes
- **Service Management**: Start/stop services, manage processes

### üîí LOCK FILE REQUIREMENTS
**CRITICAL**: All operations require a valid lock file to proceed.

#### Lock File Structure
```json
{
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-10T20:00:00Z",
  "authorized_agent": "ask-agent",
  "permissions": {
    "install_packages": true,
    "modify_config": true,
    "create_files": true,
    "git_operations": true
  },
  "scope": {
    "packages": ["goose-cli", "cursor-agent", "vscode-extensions"],
    "files": ["package.json", ".vscode/settings.json", "goose.config.yaml"],
    "directories": ["scripts/", ".vscode/", "node_modules/"]
  },
  "expires": "2025-01-10T22:00:00Z",
  "signature": "sha256:..."
}
```

#### Lock File Locations
- Primary: `.ask-agent.lock`
- Backup: `.locks/ask-agent.lock`
- Temporary: `.temp/ask-agent.lock`

## Workflow

### 1. Lock File Validation
Before any operation:
```bash
# Check if lock file exists and is valid
if [ -f ".ask-agent.lock" ]; then
  # Validate timestamp, signature, permissions
  # Proceed if valid
else
  # Request lock file creation
  echo "‚ùå No valid lock file found. Requesting authorization..."
fi
```

### 2. Operation Execution
With valid lock file:
- Execute requested operations
- Log all changes
- Update lock file if needed
- Clean up temporary files

### 3. Post-Operation
- Verify installations
- Test functionality
- Update documentation
- Report results

## Installation Capabilities

### Package Managers
- **npm/yarn/pnpm**: Node.js packages
- **pip/conda**: Python packages
- **cargo**: Rust packages
- **go install**: Go packages
- **apt/yum/brew**: System packages

### Extensions & Tools
- **VS Code Extensions**: Install from marketplace
- **Browser Extensions**: Chrome, Firefox, Edge
- **CLI Tools**: Development utilities
- **IDE Plugins**: JetBrains, Vim, Emacs

### Environment Configuration
- **Node.js**: Version management, global packages
- **Python**: Virtual environments, package management
- **Rust**: Toolchain, cargo configuration
- **Go**: Module management, workspace setup

## Lock File Management

### Creating Lock Files
```bash
# Generate new lock file
ask-agent create-lock --scope "goose-installation" --duration "2h"
```

### Validating Lock Files
```bash
# Check lock file validity
ask-agent validate-lock .ask-agent.lock
```

### Updating Lock Files
```bash
# Extend lock file duration
ask-agent extend-lock --duration "1h"
```

## Error Handling

### Missing Lock File
```
‚ùå Operation denied: No valid lock file found
üí° To proceed, create a lock file with: ask-agent create-lock
```

### Expired Lock File
```
‚ùå Operation denied: Lock file expired
üí° To proceed, create a new lock file with: ask-agent create-lock
```

### Invalid Permissions
```
‚ùå Operation denied: Insufficient permissions in lock file
üí° Required permission: install_packages
üí° Current permissions: read_only
```

## Security Features

### Signature Validation
- All lock files must be cryptographically signed
- Signature verification before any operation
- Tamper detection and prevention

### Time-based Expiration
- Lock files expire automatically
- Configurable expiration times
- Emergency override procedures

### Audit Logging
- All operations logged with timestamps
- Lock file access tracking
- Change history maintained

## Example Usage

### Installing Goose with Lock File
```bash
# 1. Create lock file
ask-agent create-lock --scope "goose-installation" --duration "1h"

# 2. Install Goose
ask-agent install-package goose-cli --method cargo

# 3. Install VS Code extension
ask-agent install-extension block.goose

# 4. Configure environment
ask-agent configure-goose --provider cursor-agent

# 5. Test installation
ask-agent test-goose-installation
```

### Environment Maintenance
```bash
# Update dependencies with lock file
ask-agent update-dependencies --lock-file .ask-agent.lock

# Clean up old packages
ask-agent cleanup --keep-lock-file

# Backup configuration
ask-agent backup-config --include-lock-files
```

## Integration with Cursor

### VS Code Integration
- Lock file status in status bar
- Permission indicators in interface
- One-click lock file creation
- Operation approval dialogs

### Command Palette
- `Ask Agent: Create Lock File`
- `Ask Agent: Install Package`
- `Ask Agent: Validate Environment`
- `Ask Agent: Show Lock Status`

## Monitoring & Reporting

### Status Dashboard
- Current lock file status
- Recent operations log
- Environment health check
- Permission audit trail

### Alerts & Notifications
- Lock file expiration warnings
- Failed operation notifications
- Security violation alerts
- Environment drift detection
