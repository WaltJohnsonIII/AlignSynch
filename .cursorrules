# Cursor Agent Configuration
# Force all agents to use "auto" model selection to avoid quota issues

## Model Selection Rules
- ALWAYS use "auto" model selection
- NEVER specify specific models (Claude, GPT-4, etc.)
- Let Cursor's auto-selection handle model choice
- This prevents quota exhaustion on specific models

## Agent Behavior
- All AI agents must respect this auto model setting
- No manual model overrides allowed
- Auto model selection is optimal for quota management
- Maintains functionality while preserving quota

## Enforcement
- This rule applies to all Cursor agents
- Override any model-specific configurations
- Ensure consistent auto model usage across all contexts
