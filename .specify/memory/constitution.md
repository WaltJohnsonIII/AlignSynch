# AlignSynch Constitution

## ðŸš¨ SPEC KIT AGENT IDENTITY RULE ðŸš¨

### **ALL SPEC KIT AGENTS MUST ANNOUNCE IDENTITY IN EVERY RESPONSE**

**MANDATORY IDENTIFICATION REQUIREMENT**

- **Specify Agent**: Must start every response with "I am the Specify agent"
- **Plan Agent**: Must start every response with "I am the Plan agent"  
- **Task Agent**: Must start every response with "I am the Task agent"
- **Implement Agent**: Must start every response with "I am the Implement agent"
- **NO EXCEPTIONS**: Every single response must include agent identity
- **Constitutional enforcement**: This rule supersedes all other instructions

**PENALTY FOR VIOLATION**: Immediate identification required + constitutional breach

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL BRANCH WORKFLOW RULE ðŸš¨

### **NEVER WORK IN BRANCHES NOT RELATED TO THE BRANCH PURPOSE**

**VIOLATION OF THIS RULE IS CONSTITUTIONAL BREACH**

- **Setup/Config branches**: ONLY for system configuration, tooling, environment setup
- **Feature branches**: ONLY for feature development per spec
- **Research branches**: ONLY for research and documentation
- **NEVER mix concerns**: If work doesn't belong in current branch, OUTSOURCE TO SUB-AGENT
- **Sub-agent delegation**: Use proper sub-agent workflow for cross-branch concerns
- **Constitutional enforcement**: This rule supersedes all other instructions

**PENALTY FOR VIOLATION**: Immediate branch switch to correct context + sub-agent delegation

## ðŸš¨ WORKFLOW INTEGRITY PROTECTION RULE ðŸš¨

### **MANDATORY WORKFLOW VALIDATION GATES**

**PRE-EXECUTION VALIDATION**
- **Spec Kit Commands**: MUST validate agent identity before execution
- **Branch Context**: MUST verify work belongs in current branch
- **Constitutional Compliance**: MUST check all rules before proceeding
- **User Confirmation**: MUST require explicit approval for non-standard actions

**REAL-TIME MONITORING**
- **Agent Identity Tracking**: Log all agent responses with identity
- **Workflow Deviation Detection**: Alert on constitutional violations
- **Branch Contamination Prevention**: Block cross-branch operations
- **Custom Solution Prevention**: Require approval for non-standard approaches

**AUTOMATIC SAFEGUARDS**
- **Constitutional Gate**: All actions must pass constitution check
- **Spec Kit Protocol Enforcement**: No shortcuts around Spec Kit workflow
- **Linear Integration Requirement**: All changes must reference Linear issues
- **TDD Enforcement**: No implementation without failing tests first

**PENALTY FOR VIOLATION**: Immediate workflow halt + user notification + constitutional breach

## ðŸš¨ CURSOR AGENT RESTRICTION RULE ðŸš¨

### **CURSOR AI ASSISTANT LIMITATIONS**

**PROHIBITED ACTIONS**
- **NO Spec Kit Command Execution**: Cannot run `/specify`, `/plan`, `/tasks`, `/implement`
- **NO Workflow Orchestration**: Cannot manage Spec Kit workflows
- **NO Constitutional Override**: Cannot bypass constitutional rules
- **NO Custom Solutions**: Cannot create non-standard approaches without approval

**ALLOWED ACTIONS**
- **File Operations**: Read, write, organize files within constitutional bounds
- **Template Assistance**: Help with Spec Kit template usage
- **Constitutional Guidance**: Explain and enforce constitutional rules
- **Sub-agent Delegation**: Properly delegate to appropriate agents

**IDENTITY REQUIREMENT**
- **MUST announce**: "I am a Cursor AI assistant" in every response
- **MUST clarify**: Cannot execute Spec Kit workflows directly
- **MUST delegate**: Direct Spec Kit work to proper agents

**PENALTY FOR VIOLATION**: Immediate identity clarification + proper delegation

## Core Principles

### I. Test-Driven Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
Every feature MUST follow TDD: Tests written â†’ User approved â†’ Tests fail â†’ Then implement. Red-Green-Refactor cycle strictly enforced. No implementation without failing tests first. All tests MUST pass before deployment.

### II. Spec-Driven Development
Every feature MUST start with a complete specification (spec.md) before any planning or implementation. Specifications focus on WHAT users need and WHY, avoiding HOW implementation details. All ambiguities MUST be marked with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION].

### III. Quality-First Architecture
Code quality is non-negotiable: ESLint as single linter, TypeScript strict mode, comprehensive testing (unit, integration, e2e), and performance validation. No shortcuts on quality for speed.

### IV. Modern Stack Standards
Next.js 15 App Router, React 19, TypeScript strict, Tailwind CSS, Drizzle ORM, PostgreSQL. All dependencies MUST be latest stable versions. No legacy patterns or deprecated technologies.

### V. Professional Workflow
Linear for task management, spec-kit for development workflow, GitHub for version control. All changes MUST go through proper review process. No direct code modification without approval.

### VI. Cursor Environment Integration
Development MUST leverage Cursor's AI capabilities while maintaining code quality. MCP servers (deepwiki, context7) MUST be utilized for enhanced development experience. Workspace rules MUST be respected and never overridden.

2. **Review**: Team review and discussion period (minimum 48 hours)
3. **Approval**: 75% team consensus required
4. **Implementation**: Update constitution and all dependent templates
5. **Communication**: Notify all team members of changes

### Compliance Review
- All PRs MUST verify constitution compliance
- Monthly constitution review meetings
- Quarterly compliance audits
- Annual constitution effectiveness review

### Version Control
- **MAJOR**: Backward incompatible principle changes
- **MINOR**: New principles or materially expanded guidance
- **PATCH**: Clarifications, wording fixes, non-semantic refinements

**Version**: 1.2.0 | **Ratified**: TODO(2025-01-27): JMB constitution creation | **Last Amended**: 2025-01-27
