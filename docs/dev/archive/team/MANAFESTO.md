# AlignSynch Team Manifesto

## Our Core Operating Principles

**We are committed to collaborative excellence through systematic, tool-driven development.**

### 1. Tool-First Philosophy
- **No building from scratch** - We use existing, proven solutions
- **Best-in-class selection** - We choose the most mature, well-supported tools
- **Research before implementation** - We investigate options thoroughly before committing
- **MCP server integration** - We enhance our capabilities through proper tool integration

### 2. Conversational Collaboration
- **Real-time dialogue** - We work together, not in isolation
- **Context preservation** - We maintain awareness of where we are and where we're going
- **Iterative refinement** - We improve through multiple cycles of analysis and feedback
- **Human-AI partnership** - We leverage each other's strengths

### 3. Systematic Excellence
- **Checklists and playbooks** - We follow proven processes
- **Memory and context management** - We maintain continuity across sessions
- **Constitutional compliance** - We adhere to established principles
- **Quality gates** - We validate before proceeding

### 4. Continuous Improvement
- **Learning from mistakes** - We don't repeat the same errors
- **Process optimization** - We refine our workflows constantly
- **Tool enhancement** - We expand our capabilities systematically
- **Team multiplication** - We create 2+2=7 outcomes through collaboration
## Critical Success Factors

### 5. Cursor IDE Mastery
- **System prompt optimization** - We ensure context is immediately available
- **Memory configuration** - We maintain persistent awareness across sessions
- **Tool management** - We use only necessary tools at the right time
- **Settings optimization** - We configure for maximum efficiency

### 6. Context Preservation Protocol
- **Session continuity** - We never lose track of where we are
- **Memory systems integration** - We connect Cursor, Spec Kit, and external memory
- **Documentation hierarchy** - We organize information for maximum accessibility
- **Checklist-driven startup** - We follow systematic initialization procedures

### 7. Adversarial Excellence
- **Push back constructively** - We challenge assumptions and improve decisions
- **Research-driven decisions** - We investigate thoroughly before committing
- **Tool utilization** - We leverage MCPs, Context7, and other resources
- **Quality validation** - We ensure excellence before delivery

## Implementation Requirements

### Phase 1: Foundation (Immediate)
1. **Manifesto completion** - This document serves as our operating principles
2. **Commitment to Excellence** - Separate document defining our quality standards
3. **Spec Kit integration** - Proper workflow and rule enforcement

### Phase 2: Docker MCP Foundation (Next)
1. **Docker MCP installation** - Official server for unlimited tool access
2. **Tool discovery and cataloging** - Explore available capabilities
3. **Specialist agent architecture** - Death by a thousand specialist tools
4. **Context separation strategy** - Solve the context window problem

### Phase 3: Team Multiplication (Future)
1. **Agent definition** - Clear roles and responsibilities
2. **Resource allocation** - Scripts, templates, and memory systems
3. **Quality gates** - Testing and validation frameworks

## Success Metrics
- **Zero context loss** between sessions
- **Systematic tool usage** without manual intervention
- **Constitutional compliance** in all decisions
- **2+2=7 outcomes** through collaborative excellence

## Document Framework
- **Manifesto** (this document) - Core operating principles
- **Agents/** - Specialist agent definitions and configurations
- **Playbooks/** - Standard operating procedures and workflows
- **Templates/** - Reusable document templates
- **Memory/** - Constitutional principles and persistent knowledge
- **Scripts/** - Automation and utility scripts

## Tool Architecture
### Docker MCP (Gateway)
- **Purpose**: Unlimited tool access through containerization
- **Installation**: `npx @smithery/cli install docker-mcp --client claude`
- **Configuration**: Cursor MCP config file

### Specialist Agents
1. **Infrastructure Agent** - Docker, containers, orchestration
2. **Data Agent** - Vector databases, graph databases, Redis
3. **Deployment Agent** - Vercel, GitHub, CI/CD
4. **AI Agent** - OpenRouter, agent orchestration
5. **Development Agent** - Git, code management, testing

### Context Separation Strategy
- **Focused tool sets** for each agent type
- **Specialized knowledge** for each domain
- **Clear handoff protocols** between agents
- **Context preservation** across agent switches
