# Feature Specification: Smart Image Component

**Feature Branch**: `feature/004-smart-image-replacement`
**Created**: 2025-09-08
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Replace all placeholder images with suitable replacements, defaulting to a gray-tone SVG gradient or user initials if no image exists. The feature should be controlled by a feature flag and be mindful of a future DAM integration."

---

## 1. User Story

**As a** user,
**I want to** see visually appealing placeholders (like gradients or my initials) instead of generic, broken, or missing images,
**So that** the application feels more polished, professional, and complete even when specific images are not available.

## 2. Acceptance Criteria

1.  **Given** a user has a valid avatar URL,
    **When** their profile is displayed,
    **Then** their actual avatar image is shown.

2.  **Given** a user does *not* have an avatar URL,
    **When** their profile is displayed and the `smart-image-replacement` feature flag is ON,
    **Then** an SVG with their initials on a gray-tone gradient background is shown.

3.  **Given** a generic content card (e.g., a quiz card) is missing an image URL,
    **When** the card is displayed and the `smart-image-replacement` feature flag is ON,
    **Then** a visually pleasing, generic gray-tone SVG gradient is shown.

4.  **Given** any image is missing its `src`,
    **When** the `smart-image-replacement` feature flag is OFF,
    **Then** the system should render the default browser/framework behavior for a missing image.

## 3. Functional Requirements

-   **FR-001**: A new reusable component, `<SmartImage />`, MUST be created.
-   **FR-002**: The component MUST accept all standard Next.js `<Image />` props to be a drop-in replacement.
-   **FR-003**: The component MUST render a fallback if the `src` prop is null, undefined, or an invalid/broken path.
-   **FR-004**: The fallback for avatars MUST be an SVG containing the user's initials, derived from a `name` prop.
-   **FR-005**: The fallback for all other images MUST be a generated SVG gradient.
-   **FR-006**: All initial fallback gradients MUST use a grayscale/mock-up color palette.
-   **FR-007**: The component's fallback behavior MUST be controlled by the `smart-image-replacement` PostHog feature flag.
-   **FR-008**: The component architecture MUST allow for easy extension of color palettes in the future.
