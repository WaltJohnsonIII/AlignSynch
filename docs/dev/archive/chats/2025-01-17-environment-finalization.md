## Chat Content (Word-for-Word)

### User Message 1
"We need to finish whatever tasks were left incomplete in this previous chat and make sure we understand what the criteria will be for the agent that we created to find resources in a master directory. And number two, we need to make sure we understand how to finalize these configuration changes, commit, version, and spin off a feature flag-worthy dev environment that is completely configured, tested, As completely working and ready to add a feature flag through linear."

### User Message 2
"I had attached the previous chat to context. I'm not sure why that wasn't recognized. But the whole point of this reinstantiation of a very large complex that has been totally corrupted or broken by purser agents over the last couple weeks is to start fresh. Therefore, the information in the docs directory is not to be in context. You're reading really old things. Where is the documentation that we put in the new cursor environment to be clean and work with the spec kit, copilot, GitHub methodology and linear agents that can be subtasked and background to function within the spec kit methodology. Please re-evaluate your analysis only based on information outside of the document directory."

### User Message 3
"Please proceed with your plan and to do's."

### User Message 4
"Can you provide a link to the Vercel deployed production environment?"

### User Message 5
"It's prompting me to set up the project on Vercel. However, this was already connected to the GitHub repository and an existing Vercel project. I don't want the dev environment that I'm in and that it's asking me to set up deployed to Vercel. We need the preview version and then we need the production version. This should be the production version, correct? Excuse me, this should be the dev is the local, staging is preview, with feature flags for each preview specification. And then what's deployed to production is the working app is untouchable and rollbackable if we mess it up."

### User Message 6
"I was under the impression all this was going to get set up with linear and cursor VS code."

### User Message 7
"It sounds good in general. Let's refine this set of tasks that you are suggesting. Can you tell me the difference between the new cursor features for integrated or internal integration with linear versus the MCP server I've used in the past? They are different, correct?"

### User Message 8
"I assume we'll want to use a combination of both. I would prefer not to be vendor locked into Cursor, although for the time being, to get this project going fast, we do whatever is necessary. The linear API key slash personal token is in this project somewhere. Did you find it? Also, what is the best solution and setup if we're going to standardize on post-hog to centralize all app? Product and company growth all in one dashboard but still use linear."

### User Message 9
"Please review the current active tab visible in cursor. Those are the large majority of all API keys I've initiated since the beginning of this project. You need to organize them in the source of truth .local file in the dev environment. You have permission to access all .local or environment files in this project. Temporarily to get all our keys in one place organized by those we're going to use now and by those that we need to index or have available in the source of truth.local but that we will not use. And we can also pull most of the keys Please let me know what the best plan is and if you were intending to use the Vercel sidebar management or VS Code secret management. Tell me what we decided, but let's just do this simply. We should have all the keys we need, put them in an organized.local file to use now, and make sure the source of truth is very well organized and populated with actual keys that we will then protect after we're done organizing."

### User Message 10

"her"

### User Message 12
"Please put a copy of all of the chats that have been initiated during this session and in this environment to the slash docs slash dev slash archive slash chats directory. I think the directory will need to be completed. And just save the entire content of all chats by date and approximate subject. And change the file names to be more brief subject or topic related, but not too long."

### User Message 13
"And if you are summarizing instead of copying the exact text word for word in order by individual chat as a full document, we need to do that and you can put your summary at the top of those documents marked in a callout as a summary."
