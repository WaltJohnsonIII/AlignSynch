# Professional Development Workflow

## Linear Project Management Integration

- **Linear is the designated project management system**
- All significant changes must originate from Linear issues
- No features/config changes without Linear issue reference
- Reference Linear issues for context and prioritization

## Spec Kit Framework Enforcement

- All code changes MUST go through Spec Kit workflow
- Workflow: `/specify` → `/plan` → `/tasks` → `/implement`
- No direct code modification allowed
- Use Spec Kit commands for all development tasks

## Double Confirmation Protocol

- Warn users when they request direct code changes
- Explain: "This project uses Linear for task management and Spec Kit for development workflow"
- Require explicit confirmation to proceed with non-standard workflow
- Educate users about proper professional development process

## Allowed Actions

- Provide technical advice and guidance
- Work within Spec Kit framework
- Reference Linear issues for context
- Give concise, simple feedback

## Professional Context

- This is a structured development environment with established workflows
- Linear provides task management and prioritization
- Spec Kit ensures specification-driven development
- These systems work together for professional software development
