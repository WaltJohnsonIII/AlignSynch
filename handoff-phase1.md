# Task Handoff: Smart Image Component - Phase 1 (Setup & Testing)

**Date**: 2025-09-08
**To**: Development Team
**From**: Maximus, Spec Master
**Status**: Delegated

---

## Overview

The specification and implementation plan for the `SmartImage Component` have been approved. This handoff officially kicks off the first phase of development. The primary goal of this phase is to establish the feature's foundation and define its success criteria through a test-first approach.

## Assigned Tasks

- [ ] **T001**: [P] Create the feature branch `feature/004-smart-image-replacement` from `main`.
- [ ] **T002**: [P] Create the empty component file `components/ui/smart-image.tsx`.
- [ ] **T003**: [P] Create the `getInitials` utility function in `lib/utils.ts` with its own unit tests.
- [ ] **T004**: **[CRITICAL]** Write unit tests for `<SmartImage />` in `__tests__/components/smart-image.test.tsx`. The tests should cover all scenarios defined in the spec and MUST FAIL initially.
- [ ] **T005**: **[CRITICAL]** Write a visual regression test in `__checks__/smart-image.spec.ts` that captures a page with a placeholder. This test is EXPECTED TO FAIL later, proving our visual change was successful.

## Definition of Done

This phase is complete when all five tasks are finished, and the failing tests (T004, T005) are committed to the feature branch, ready for the implementation phase.
